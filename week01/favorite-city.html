    <h1>Abuja Nigeria</h1>
    <p>Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria, officially designated in 1991 to replace Lagos as the nationâ€™s capital.
        Located at
        the center of the country, it was carefully planned to symbolize unity and provide equal access from all
        regions. The
        city is known for its well-structured layout, clean environment, and modern infrastructure. Abuja is home to key
        landmarks such as the Nigerian National Mosque, the National Christian Centre, and the iconic Aso Rock, which
        towers
        over the city.</p>
